=> 4 ways to declare variables
1. Automatically
2. Using var
3. Using let
4. Using const

*Note: before JavaScript has two scope global and function scope.


## let keyword
=> variable declared with let have block scope, must be declared before use and cannot be redeclared in the same scope

# Block scope
 {
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x); // it gives an error message

# function scope
function myFun(){
  let x = 10;
}

*Note: Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

=> variable declared with var can be redeclared.
## Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program:

Example
var x = 2;
// Now x is 2

var x = 3;
// Now x is 3

## With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed:

Example
var x = 2;   // Allowed
let x = 3;   // Not allowed

{
let x = 2;   // Allowed
let x = 3;   // Not allowed
}

{
let x = 2;   // Allowed
var x = 3;   // Not allowed
}

## Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed:

Example
let x = 2;   // Allowed

{
let x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
let x = 4;    // Allowed
}


## Let Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
 
carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
 
=> Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

*Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:

Example
carName = "Saab";
let carName = "Volvo";
*here let hoisted to the top of the block, but we can not use it. it is just hoisted to the top of the block.

######## const ##############
=> variable defined with const cannot be redeclared, reassign and it has block scope.

example:
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

=> JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

Correct
const PI = 3.14159265359;

Incorrect
const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;

*Note: consider a variable, string, and array declared with const is a box. means each reference is constant. we can not change the box, reassign the box. but we can change the box value of array and object.
*Change the elements of constant array
*Change the properties of constant object

const has hoisting behavior similar to the let keyword.

***************** Operators ************
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --, ** exponential(ES2016:ES7)

Assignment: =, +=, *=, /=, %=, **=

Comparison: ==, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=, !=, ?

Concatenation: when we use + as string concatenation. here string priority is higher.
=> string + number = return string.

Logical Operators: &&, || and !

Type Operators: typeof(return the type of a variable), instanceof (return true if an object is an instance of an object type)

example at line 162


## Note: 
literals: 10, 13.34
variable: a, b, name, etc
expression: (100 + 50)
