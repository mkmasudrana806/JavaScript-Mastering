######### Statement #########
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

## JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

=> JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
